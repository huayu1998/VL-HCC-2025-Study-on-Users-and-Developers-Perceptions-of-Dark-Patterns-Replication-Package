dark patterns are nuanced. a dark pattern to nudge or even force people to update their software is a required evil -- average users are awful at updating their software.

ultimately, if it harms the user in any way, or sacrifices privacy, or is otherwise not in the best interest of the user in any way, they have no place in software.

dark patterns that encourage users to do things in their best interest (that is, *GENUINELY* their best interest, e.g. update nudges, or to prevent mistakes by confirming destructive actions) are completely fair game, and even a moral responsibility that they *are* implemented.
